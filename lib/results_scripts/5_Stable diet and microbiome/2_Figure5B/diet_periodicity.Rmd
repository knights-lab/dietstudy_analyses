#Reviewer comment #2

I really like the tree-based representation of dietary intake! When analyzing the individualized nature of dietary intake, did the authors consider predictable patterns in individual dietary intake? The authors write that the subjects "often consume meals with conventional food pairings". Are there patterns or some sort of periodicity (e.g., autoregressive models) in dietary intake? Can this affect/predict the diet-microbiome interactions?

# Thoughts to address
Week day v. weekend diet? 

Week day microbiome v. weekend? Are microbiome samples from Wednesdayâ€™s more similar to themselves than compared to other days of the week for example? Can we show this in diet?

Potential to include the identification of patterns from dietary principal coordinates as it makes sense for this discussion.
