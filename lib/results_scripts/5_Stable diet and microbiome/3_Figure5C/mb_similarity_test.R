### Reviewer comment #1 ###

#Figure S2 monte carlo test sounds strange for what the authors want to test (page 4 top). 
#If the idea is to test whether the day before was the most similar, 
#why not just test it directly and compare with distance to other days, 
#rather than this permutation test? Am I missing something? 
#And why is Bray-Curtis distance used here?

### Reviewer comment #2 ###

#The authors state that "each subject's microbiome samples were most similar to 
#their own sample from the previous day compared to all other timepoints from that subject".
#Was this done also with comparing to all other unrelated samples, or only to samples within
#the same subject? The proper analysis should be to compare as background to the whole cohort.


### Notes from meeting with Dan ###

#so the analysis should be redone using the Aitchison's distance. 
#Get each day's distance to the next day within in a person and compare to all 
# of the distances that are 2 or more days apart.

#Then test whether the mean difference is <0 with a t-test. 

# load map
map <- read.delim(file = "data/maps/SampleID_map.txt")
map <- map[colnames(map) %in% c("X.SampleID", "UserName","StudyDayNo","Sample.Week.Day")]

# load mb table for everyone
mb <- read.delim("data/processed_tax/taxonomy_clr_s.txt", row = 1)

# get mb distances (euclidean from clr)
mbdist <- dist(t(mb))
mbdist <- as.matrix(mbdist)

#limit map to the people with mb samples
map <- map[map$X.SampleID %in% colnames(mb),]
map <- droplevels(map)

# listify distance matrices by person
list.mbdist<- NULL

for (i in seq_along(unique(map$UserName))){
  a <- as.character(unique(map$UserName)[i])
  ids <- droplevels(map$X.SampleID[map$UserName == a])
  
  sub.mbdist <- mbdist[rownames(mbdist) %in% ids,colnames(mbdist) %in% ids]
  list.mbdist[[i]] <- sub.mbdist
  
} 

# calculate distance to the next day and distance to days 2 days apart

### This is the meat of the problem, and where I think I'm probably messing up! ###
